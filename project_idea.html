        <h1>Project Idea: The Spotter</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 50px">
          For the last twelve months I have been watching videos of people on the internet fling quadcopters (also named drones) into the air for fun or for photography or agriculture. I’ve always wanted to get one and this year when the quarantine and lockdowns were enforced I decided to get one. Now with the excitement of the hobby also came with laws and regulations. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) demands that any pilot or user of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) have a spotter at all times. This means that every time I fire up my drone, by law, I need to have another person stand next to me to watch out for potential hazards or dangers.<br><br>

          To some this may seem like a law made for the “good and safety” of everyone flying drones. However, this one rule is somewhat unrealistic. Not all drones are made the same. Not all drones are the same size. Not all drones can be potentially harmful. Some drones weigh 50g, some weigh as much as 600g and heavier. So instead of having a human stand beside the pilot with limited knowledge of the hobby and of the laws, I thought “why not develop a device placed within reach of the pilot to assist with spotter law?.”<br><br>

          I have named my project idea “The Spotter.” It’s a piece of technology with all sorts of sensors and other types of technology built into it. It could be used commercially, agriculturally, or even on the hobbyist level. This device would have different models varying on the use and features are required for the job.<br><br>

          A cinematic model could be made. This would be a monitor looking and analysing the footage taken by the pilot (analysing a live feed) and would take controls of the drone to get the best shot of the subject, or help adjust the speed of the drone in high speed scenes. This would be similar to autonomy with motor vehicles, where the device would take control of the drone but at any time the human would be able to intervene if necessary. The Spotter system could also assist the pilot with adjusting the video settings like white balance, ISO, zoom, and focus on the fly. It’s main focus would be on getting the best shot first, saving time and money for the production crew.<br><br>

          Another use case could be with agriculture. DJI are the leaders in excellent quality drone products for cinematography and agriculture with their already made Agriculture drones. However, these systems are extremely expensive. The Spotter could be a great system to implement as an Australian developed product for Australian farmers. The Spotter system could be used to accurately map an area in 3D using onboard cameras and sensors. It could adjust for extreme weather like heat, rain, hail or wind. Heat telling the pilot the heat at ground level (as this could affect) and notifying the pilot the drone’s operating temperature. Rain, notify the pilot of the current precipitation after scanning GPS mapping. Hail, how large the hail is and the impact the hail could have on crops or the property. With wind, it would be able to adjust its own speed, height and stability in windy conditions to get the best results possible.<br><br>

          Lastly, The Spotter’s use in the hobbyist area of drone flying. As mentioned previously the spotter rule as set out by CASA is for the safety of people at parks, and other aircraft such as planes, helicopters, or jets. The Spotter’s job would be to alarm or alert the pilot through a large easily heard speaker. The Spotter could be programmed to beep once when there are civilians within 30 meters, or beep three times when it knows another aircraft is nearby and the pilot should land the drone immediately. Additionally, the system may also be able to speak to the pilot and say “Cation: Civilians within 30 meters of operation” or “Warning: Aircraft nearby. Land immediately.”<br><br>

          Through meticulous engineering, prototyping, machine learning, and testing; I believe that this could be achieved. After The Spotter is tested and confirmed ready it would then be given to CASA for them to test and approve for use in the industry.<br><br>

          Some of the features that could be built into the device would be artificial intelligence to identify people within 30 meters of the pilot, have a GPS module to make sure there is always communication with the drone in the event of a failure with loss of controls, it would always safely return to the pilot so that controls could be gained again and the drone landed. I would want the device’s AI to monitor local radios and notify if there are any aircrafts within a few kilometers of the drone itself. This would eliminate the need for a human to be present with the pilot.<br><br>

          I believe this would be a massive undertaking needing a large team of experts in the fields of: artificial intelligence, integration of radio frequencies, and the integration of high definition cameras, sensors and global positioning for the GPS. For a project this size without any investors or a team big enough with the right experience it would be extremely difficult to achieve what I envision The Spotter to be. Not only with the software side of things, but the manufacture of the hardware to host the software. I don’t see this feasible. However, with the right backing and the right team and with the technology we currently have now in 2020 it would indeed be possible.<br><br>

          If this project were to be successful, it could mean a huge change in the industry. From how people perceive drones and quadcopters, to how cinematography could take place or even huge changes with the relationship of drones and agriculture. This would mean that in Australia and possibly world-wide we could see a shift in each country's laws and regulations in the matter of safety and UAVs. The vision of The Spotter would be to take an ever changing, dynamic, exciting industry and really show off the capabilities, and limitations, of drone hardware and associated softwares.<br><br>

        <h1>My Ideal Job in IT</h1>

        <h2><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50531327?type=standard#searchRequestToken=d62bd05a-e714-4076-9883-1617dca08967" target="_blank">Cyber Security Analyst</a></h2>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          This role involves skills to be applied to both the cloud and network security by monitoring alerts, documenting and monitoring incident responses, actively scanning for possible threats and utilising SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools and firewall configuration. The CyberSec Analyst will also be supporting and working closely with project management to ensure effective security operation.<br><br>

          To be a successful candidate for this role it requires three to five years of commercial experience as cyber security analyst, experience with SIEM configuration and management, Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) or equivalent certification and ISO/IEC 27000, in addition to, experience with network security systems and tools, strong problem solving ability, and, lastly, overall excellent office competence in organising, communication and collaborative in a team to meet deadlines.<br><br>

          My current experience is six months in a level 1 technical support officer role, I have six years personal experience with repairing laptops and desktops, and building computers. As a graphic designer I worked in an office environment in a team meeting deadlines, communicating to other businesses and our branches over the phone, through emails and in person.<br><br>

          In order to obtain the skills needed to be a Cyber Security Analyst first begins the degree I’m currently enrolled in, Bachelor of Information Technology. This will assist me

           with the experience and industry knowledge to get a role in Technical Support and use the experience there as a foundation to build upon my current skill set and develop the necessary skills over a period of two to three years for a management position. Having this management position will allow me to build proficiency in managing and assisting a team to achieve the best results for the company or our clients. I understand that practicing ITIL is very favourable in a role like this so making sure I have a sound understanding is paramount to my success in the role and progressing in my career.<br><br>

          In order to move in the direction of security I would then tackle an undergraduate degree in security. At the time of writing this there is the Bachelor of Security Studies (offered by Macquarie University), Bachelor of Science (Security)(offered by Edith Cowan University), or the Bachelor of Social Science with a Major in Security and Counter Terrorism (offered by Swinburn Online) amongst many others disciplined in security. Majority of these courses are expected to take me three to four years to complete. After I have accomplished this I would then seek a role in security whether it’d be a Cyber Security Consultant or IT Security Officer. After I have secured one of these roles in the security field I would look at what other Cyber Security Analyst roles and note what job descriptions have certifications or skills in common and if I don’t have those then to study those. I estimate that this will take me about ten to twelve years to achieve this, possibly longer. I may change my mind as I journey through my career in IT but I know that once I have my mind set on something I will do the best that I can.

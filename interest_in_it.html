        <h1>My Interest in IT</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          My interests in IT are new technologies in the industry, networking and security, and to learn as much as I can about programming languages, how things work, how and why things do what they do.<br><br>

          My interest in IT started at a very young age. When I was in nappies I would play the video game Croc on my Dad’s computer and fiddle around with the computer’s settings. He would often come home from work to the cursor, icons and even screen orientation changed, I would change those settings back to default so he could check his email. I was hooked. After that I’ve always wanted built a PC and in 2014 saved enough money to build a custom gaming PC. The research, looking at specs and making sure all parts were compatible with one another was a lot of fun. I loved it! I loved researching and learning more about how computers worked.

        <p style="margin-top: 100px">
          I chose RMIT as I was looking for a degree that would give me a solid foundation in IT as well as it’s expansive view of other sectors allowing the discovery of more things about the industry.<br><br>

          I expect to learn at least one programming language, understand a little more about how vast the It industry is, what other sectors of the industry may peak my interests and just to set me up for my next role in IT and possibly make some friends along the way. I’m hoping that with all my efforts in the degree and extra curricular research, I will be well equipped for a Technical Support or Help Desk position to officially begin my career in IT.
